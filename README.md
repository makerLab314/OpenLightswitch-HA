# OpenLightswitch-HA
OpenLightswitch-HA is an open-source project that uses an Arduino WiFi Rev2, SG90 servo, and touch sensor to remotely or locally toggle standard European light switches via MQTT. It enables smart control without modifying electrical wiring, using a custom 3D-printed mount. Compatible with Home Assistant.
